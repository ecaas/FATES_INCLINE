SLAmax = observational constraint on max sla

SLAtop = scale SLA in each level of canopy using exponential function (allometry), recheck value for each layer for slamax (should be a lower value than the max, normally? compare to other PFT values). Not very relevant for grasses, but might make more sense for forbs!
