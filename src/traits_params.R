## We have "SLA_cm2_g". See param under - is the measurement better suited
## for that parameter? If so, should we change both, and if so should we
## adjust this one to be a bit lower?
## Default is = 0.03 m^2/gC

## Sib_pro 191.12, Suc_pra 292.49, Ver_off 164.52 in cm^2/g. Converting to m^2/gC
## by using percent Carbon per species:
## Sib_pro (191.12*0.456)/100 = 0.872 m^2/gC,
## Suc_pra (292.49*0.463)/100 = 1.35 m^2/gC,

## Juveniles were not measured specifically. Rather use minimum value of adult plants:
## Sib_pro 47.53 mm = 0.0475 m
## Suc_pra 146.2 mm = 0.146 m
## Ver_off 56.75 mm = 0.0568 m
## Default = 0.125 m = 125 mm
