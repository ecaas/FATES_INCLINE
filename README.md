# FATES_INCLINE
Repository for manuscript using the EMERALD FATES platform to simulate interactions between lowland (invading) and alpine (native) species

The 'workflow' file outlines how to get input data, set up and run simulations, and analyse output files. It draws on the other files in this repository.

In time, this repository will also contain everything necessary to reproduce the results for the manuscript, and function as detailed documentation of the methods used.

'change_param_file' will be a script to change parameter files before simulations.

'DataPrep.R' is an R script for transforming raw data from the INCLINE project into a table of mean, min, and max values, per measured trait, per species.

'output_plots' is a Python script for reading, looking at and plotting data from model runs.

'settings_INCLINE' will be the settings file used by the NorESM_LandSites_Platform to set up simulations.

'traits_params_notes' is a notepad to compare model parameters to measured traits.
