# FATES_INCLINE
Repository for manuscript using the EMERALD FATES platform to simulate interactions between lowland (invading) and alpine (native) species

The workflow file outlines how to get input data, set up and run simulations, and analyse output files. It draws on the other files in this repository.

In time, this repository will also contain everything necessary to reproduce the results for the manuscript, and function as detailed documentation of the methods used.
