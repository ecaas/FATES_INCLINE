# Using the NorESM_LandSites_Platform on a virtual machine through MobaXterm

For setting up more complex uses of the NorESM_LandSites_Platform than is
possible on Galaxy, we currently (october 2021) use a virtual machine hosted on
NREC (Norwegian Research and Education Cloud).

Having set up a virtual machine, you need to access it through some terminal.
You can use puTTy, MobaXterm or something else. Eva uses MobaXterm because it
is a bit more graphical and beginner-friendly than puTTy.
To gain access, you need to set up an SSH key pair before making the virtual
machine. Here is a useful guide:

(Note that the part on "Upload PUBLIC key to CCR IDM portal" is not necessary)

If you have admin rights on your computer, you can follow this guide to creating
your own virtual machine. Note that you first need to be given access and
resources, so contact us if you need this!
