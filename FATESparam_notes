# promising parameters from FATES
# -------------------------------------

### a quick glance at the parameters used by FATES that might be interesting.
### parameters copied from the master parameter file,
### https://github.om/NGEET/fates/blob/master/parameter_files/fates_params_default.cdl
### Compare parameters to the available measured traits:
###  "Plant_Height_m"
###	 "Wet_Mass_g"
###	 "Dry_Mass_g"
###	 "Leaf_Area_cm2"
###	 "N_percent"
###	 "C_percent"
###	 "CN_ratio"
###	 "SLA_cm2_g"
###	 "LDMC"
###	 "Leaf_Thickness_Ave_mm"
### In addition, there are the demographic traits:
### Number of leaves, longest leaf length, number of flowers etc.

double fates_allom_dbh_maxheight(fates_pft) ;
		fates_allom_dbh_maxheight:units = "cm" ;
		fates_allom_dbh_maxheight:long_name = "the diameter (if any) corresponding to maximum height, diameters may increase beyond this" ;
## Stem diameter is not measured, but might be possible to guess relative to
## the default value. Default for Arctic C3 grass is = 0.35 cm = 3.5 mm.
## Are Sibpro, Veroff, Sucpra wider or slimmer than that?

double fates_allom_la_per_sa_int(fates_pft) ;
		fates_allom_la_per_sa_int:units = "m2/cm2" ;
		fates_allom_la_per_sa_int:long_name = "Leaf area per sapwood area, intercept" ;
## We have "Leaf_Area_cm2" measured. Can we find sapwood area as well, or use
## a constant value to make different parameter values for the three species?

double fates_allom_sai_scaler(fates_pft) ;
		fates_allom_sai_scaler:units = "m2/m2" ;
		fates_allom_sai_scaler:long_name = "allometric ratio of SAI per LAI"
## LAI=Leaf Area Index, SAI=Stem Area Index. Can these be derived from SLA or
## any other traits?
## Default is 0.1 for all PFTs. Maybe best to leave as is.

double fates_c2b(fates_pft) ;
		fates_c2b:units = "ratio" ;
		fates_c2b:long_name = "Carbon to biomass multiplier of bulk structural tissues" ;
## How does this work? We have wet and dry mass (=biomass?) in grams, and
## carbon percent. Default for Arctic C3 grass = 2 (same for all the PFTs!)

double fates_dev_arbitrary_pft(fates_pft) ;
		fates_dev_arbitrary_pft:units = "unknown" ;
		fates_dev_arbitrary_pft:long_name = "Unassociated pft dimensioned free parameter that developers can use for testing arbitrary new hypotheses" ;
## Could this be relevant to use? There is another, similar parameter in the
## FATES parameter file. But how is it used, if at all, in the model?

double fates_fnrt_prof_mode(fates_pft) ;
		fates_fnrt_prof_mode:units = "index" ;
		fates_fnrt_prof_mode:long_name = "Index to select fine root profile function: 1) Jackson Beta, 2) 1-param exponential 3) 2-param exponential" ;
## What are these options, and do any of them correcpond better to our species
## than the default? Default for Arctic C3 grass = 3 (2-param exponential)

double fates_hydr_thetas_node(fates_hydr_organs, fates_pft) ;
		fates_hydr_thetas_node:units = "cm3/cm3" ;
		fates_hydr_thetas_node:long_name = "saturated water content" ;
## What is this, exactly? Could we approximate it using the measured
## wet and dry mass, and  Leaf_Thickness_Ave_mm ?
## Default is = 0.75 (for all grass PFTs, 0.65 for trees)

double fates_leaf_diameter(fates_pft) ;
		fates_leaf_diameter:units = "m" ;
		fates_leaf_diameter:long_name = "Characteristic leaf dimension" ;
## What exactly is this? Would leaf length be the same?
## Default is = 0.04 m = 40 mm (same for all PFTs)

double fates_leaf_slamax(fates_pft) ;
		fates_leaf_slamax:units = "m^2/gC" ;
		fates_leaf_slamax:long_name = "Maximum Specific Leaf Area (SLA), even if under a dense canopy" ;
## We have "SLA_cm2_g". See param under - is the measurement better suited
## for that parameter? If so, should we change both, and if so should we
## adjust this one to be a bit lower?
## Default is = 0.03 m^2/gC

double fates_leaf_slatop(fates_pft) ;
		fates_leaf_slatop:units = "m^2/gC" ;
		fates_leaf_slatop:long_name = "Specific Leaf Area (SLA) at top of canopy, projected area basis" ;
## We have "SLA_cm2_g". Almost directly transferrable?
## Default is = 0.03 m^2/gC

double fates_mort_bmort(fates_pft) ;
		fates_mort_bmort:units = "1/yr" ;
		fates_mort_bmort:long_name = "background mortality rate" ;
## Can this be estimated from the demographic data? Maybe better to leave it be,
## since we have not recorded the cause of mortality. But it might be interesting
## to compare modelled overall mortality with overall mortality in the
## demographic data.

double fates_mort_ip_age_senescence(fates_pft) ;
		fates_mort_ip_age_senescence:units = "years" ;
		fates_mort_ip_age_senescence:long_name = "Mortality cohort age senescence inflection point. If _ this mortality term is off. Setting this value turns on age dependent mortality. " ;
## Default = '_' = OFF
## Should we turn it on, if we know the max age of individuals from
## demographic data or literature?
## Similar issue for related parameters:
## fates_mort_ip_size_senescence
## fates_mort_r_age_senescence
## fates_mort_r_size_senescence

double fates_phen_season_decid(fates_pft) ;
		fates_phen_season_decid:units = "logical flag" ;
		fates_phen_season_decid:long_name = "Binary flag for seasonal-deciduous leaf habit" ;
## This should be ON, I think. Belowground parts of out species survive, but
## leaves and stems die back in the autumn.
## Default = 1 --> OK!

double fates_recruit_hgt_min(fates_pft) ;
		fates_recruit_hgt_min:units = "m" ;
		fates_recruit_hgt_min:long_name = "the minimum height (ie starting height) of a newly recruited plant" ;
## Maybe lower this to e.g. mean Juvenile height from demographic data?
## Default = 0.125 m = 125 mm

double fates_recruit_initd(fates_pft) ;
		fates_recruit_initd:units = "stems/m2" ;
		fates_recruit_initd:long_name = "initial seedling density for a cold-start near-bare-ground simulation" ;
## Depending on how we do spin-up and proper simulation, maybe this needs
## to be changed.
## Default is = 0.2 stems/m2

double fates_seed_alloc(fates_pft) ;
		fates_seed_alloc:units = "fraction" ;
		fates_seed_alloc:long_name = "fraction of available carbon balance allocated to seeds" ;
double fates_seed_alloc_mature(fates_pft) ;
    		fates_seed_alloc_mature:units = "fraction" ;
    		fates_seed_alloc_mature:long_name = "fraction of available carbon balance allocated to seeds in mature plants (adds to fates_seed_alloc)" ;
## These two params, or maybe just the latter, should be varied according to
## our study question about seeds/dispersal.
## Default is = 0.1 for small plants (same for all PTFs) and
## for mature = 0.9

double fates_seed_suppl(fates_pft) ;
		fates_seed_suppl:units = "KgC/m2/yr" ;
		fates_seed_suppl:long_name = "Supplemental external seed rain source term (non-mass conserving)" ;
## Vary according to study question to simulate increased seed rain from lowland
## Default = 0

double fates_woody(fates_pft) ;
		fates_woody:units = "logical flag" ;
		fates_woody:long_name = "Binary woody lifeform flag" ;
## Check that this is off --- OK!

double fates_hlm_pft_map(fates_hlm_pftno, fates_pft) ;
    fates_hlm_pft_map:units = "area fraction" ;
    fates_hlm_pft_map:long_name = "In fixed biogeog mode, fraction of HLM area associated with each FATES PFT" ;
## What is HLM? If we can use fixed biogeography mode, then this is probably the
## place to define how much of each PFT to start with.

double fates_phen_coldtemp ;
		fates_phen_coldtemp:units = "degrees C" ;
		fates_phen_coldtemp:long_name = "vegetation temperature exceedance that flags a cold-day for leaf-drop" ;
## Check that this looks reasonable for out species - change if not?
## Default = 7.5 (one value for all PFTs)
